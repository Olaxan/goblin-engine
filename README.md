# Goblin Engine
C++11 based data-oriented game engine based on LTU:s lab environment. Basic ECS system, physics engine, PBR, and transforms.

## Future work
Unlikely, see this is a pretty poor reference work. If updates were to be made:

- Scripting support (LUA).
- Ability to unregister instances from the ECS (hah).
- Serialisation support.
- Better scene format.
- Shadow mapping.

## Requirements
1. CMake 3+.
2. Compiler with support for lambda functions (C++11), such as VS 2013.
  
## Instructions
Put project files in the folder titled 'projects'. It must be accompanied with its own CMakeLists.txt which is used to generate a project/solution.
